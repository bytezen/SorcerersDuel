<h1>Waving Hands from <i>Duel Purpose</i></h1>

A game by Richard Bartle.<p>

	A number of years ago, Richard Bartle published a zine called <u>Sauce of
the Nile</u>. One feature I particularly liked was the rules for new games which he
produced. One game appealed to me more than the others but it never seemed to
achieve the fame it deserved. Since then Richard has rewritten some of its rules
and has tried to have it produced commercially but, as his proposed publishers
have been using delaying tactics for some time now, he has given me permission
to reprint the game. The original name of the game was Spellbinder but, as that
name has been used in a commercial game since Richard thought of it, he told me
to think up some other name. The game is a rarity as it can be classed as a
<b>fairy game</b> which is totally dependent upon skill!</p><p>

Andrew Buchanan</p><p>

</p><h2>Introduction</h2>

	This is a game concerning the imaginary conflict between two powerful 
wizards in a duel of sorcery. The two opponents perform magical gestures with 
their hands to create their supernatural weapons - spells. Some spells are so potent 
as to be able to blind a man, call forth terrifying creatures, or even kill the
unfortunate victim instantly. Consequently, each wizard must rely on his own 
cunning to be able to time enough defensive spells to avoid the brunt of his 
adversary's attack, yet deliver sufficient offensive spells of his own to 
crack the magical armour of his opponent, and kill the wizard outright.<p>

The game is an attempt to capture the spirit of such a battle in as simple yet 
exciting way as possible. The only equipment needed is pencil, paper and 
opponent. Time taken varies between 15 - 30 minutes. The inventor wishes to 
state that he has never been involved in a magical duel but would be interested 
to discover how realistic the game is for those who have been involved in
such a bout.

</p><h2>The Turn</h2>
Each turn both player's will write down in secret the directions for their wizards 
and the monsters under their wizards control.  After both players have written 
their directions for this turn, the moves are revealed at the same time and 
dealt with as if the actions specified therein occur simultaneously. Certain spells 
may alter these  circumstances. For example, you don't get to see all of your 
opponent's moves if their wizard is invisible.<p>

Each turn a player's wizard can either gesture with their hands to weave part of a 
spell, stab with their knife, or do nothing. They use both hands and each hand can act 
independently or in concord with the other.</p><p>

Monsters will obey their master's commands exactly. Monster's may change hands 
(as it were) as a result of enchantment. From that point on the monster's attacks 
are directed by the new master. Monsters may make a single attack each turn against 
a target chosen by their master or they may spend the turn doing nothing. Monsters
may attack on the turn in which they are summoned.</p><p>

Monsters are untrained, unintelligent creatures and can neither gesture nor cast spells.
Players personally acquainted with monsters who wish to vouch for their ability to cast 
spells are requested to keep quiet.</p><p>

</p><h2>Gestures</h2>

Spells are created by strings of gestures made with the hands. There are
five single-handed gestures:
<ul><li>the wiggled fingers (F)
</li><li>the proferred palm (P)
</li><li>the snap (S) 
</li><li>the wave (W)
</li><li>the digit pointing (D)
</li></ul><p>

There is one two-handed gesture: the clap (C). Both hands must be specified as
clapping in the same turn for this gesture to be valid. </p><p>

There also two non-gestures: 
</p><ul><li>stab (stab)
</li><li>nothing ( )
</li></ul><p>

The abbreviation for each gesture (or non-gesture) is used when specifing directions 
for the turn.</p><p>

Spells are cast using an ordered series of gestures. A list of spells 
and the gestures used to cast them is given in the final section. For 
example, three wiggling finger gestures on consecutive turns (noted as F-F-F) 
evokes a <b>paralysis</b> spell. The uniqueness of the game, however, is that 
a single gesture in more than one series and, hence, can be used to cast
more than one spell. Gestures may be used in multiple series provided that:
</p><ul><li>the gestures have been made in the correct sequence without interruption
</li><li>no more than one spell is created per gesture
</li><li>all gestures for one spell are made with the same hand
</li></ul><p>

For instance, the left hand could cast the F-F-F above. In the following four
turns the left hand could gesture (S-S-D-D) to finish off a <b>fireball</b> spell 
since the last five gestures would then be (F-S-S-D-D). Another alternative is to
simply perform another (F) for a second <b>paralysis</b> spell, as the last three gestures 
are still (F-F-F). If spells are used in a wise manner and frequently overlap, 
the overall number of gestures needed to cast them can be cut dramatically.</p><p>

If a gesture can be construed to create two or more spells then the caster
chooses which one to cast. For example, the last two gestures of a <b>finger
of death</b> are the same as <b>missile</b>, yet only on odd occasions would the 
latter spell be chosen in preference to the former.</p><p>

Another example of the one-spell-per-gesture concept is the following:
</p><pre>	    Right hand:     P P W S    Last 4 gestures form <b>invisibility</b>
	    Left hand:      W W W S    Last 3 gestures form <b>counter-spell</b>

</pre>	

The trouble here is the <b>invisibility</b> spell needs both hands to perform
certain gestures. However, since the final S of the left hand cannot be used to
cast two spells, it is clear that a choice must be made between the W-W-S of the 
<b>counter-spell</b> and the P-P-(w-(s of the <b>invisibility</b>. 
Here and in the rest of the document an open parenthesis, followed by a lowercase 
letter, denotes a gesture to be performed with <em>both hands</em> simultaneously. 
E.g. (w denotes a W by each hand.<p>

If the caster completes a series that casts a spell, intentionally or unintentionally,
the spell must be cast. Most of these are shot off to nowhere if not required but 
some cannot be easily discarded. For example <b>fire storm</b> gets you no matter 
where it is released. Note also that some of the larger spells have smaller 
ones incorporated within their casting series.</p><p>

All spells and monsters need a target, someone or something to  be the victim. 
Usually the target is obvious. Normally enchantments and  damaging spells are 
cast at on your opponent's wizard, whereas protection and summonning
spells are cast on your wizard. However, if your target is not the usual
one, it must be noted along with the gestures. For example, you may wish to cast a 
<b>counter-spell</b> on your own monster to stop a <b>charm monster</b> spell 
from making it attack you. The target need not exist at the time the gestures
are made. "The elemental he's about to create" is a valid target but if it still 
doesn't exist when you actually cast the spell then the spell is discarded
(but, once again, recall that certain spells <em>cannot</em> be discarded). 
Monsters will usually attack their master's opponent but if the target is different, 
e.g. another monster, then it must be written down along with the monster's action.</p><p>

	Spells can be aborted at any point during their development simply by 
performing a gesture which breaks up the series for that spell. 
There is no penalty, save having wasted some time. Note that no 
spells contain <b>stab</b> or <b>nothing</b>. Also note that nonsense (Zen?)(
gestures such as (C with just one hand are considered the same as <b>nothing</b>
(which is a fairly Zenlike concept, in and of itself).
Consequently, after one of these options is taken, all spells must start
from scratch. Note also that wizards carry only one dagger and so cannot stab 
with both hands at the same time. Wizards can, however, change hands for stabbing 
without wasting time. Such are the disadvantages of physical violence.</p><p>

Certain spells cancel one another if they take effect simultaneously. An
obvious example is <b>finger of death</b> and <b>raise dead</b>. 
Cancellation occurs when the subjects of the spells concerned are the same, 
although there are some of the heat versus cold variety which don't care who is 
the subject. Most other spells which cancel harmlessly are contradictory enchantments
(e.g. a wizard cannot both repeat last turn's gestures and give a random gesture 
with one hand when <b>amnesia</b> and  <b>confusion</b> are cast at the same time). 
If two spells seem to cancel yet are not mentioned explicitly in the section on spells,
use your common sense and you can't go far wrong (henceforth this will be known
as the <b>Cosmic Encounter Rule</b>).</p><p>

	Since spells detonate simultaneously, there is occasionally confusion
over spells which don't cancel yet which seem to depend on which happened 
first. The best example is when a monster is created and, on the same turn, hit
by a <b>fireball</b>, or something else sufficient to kill it. Since both are
simultaneous, the monster will attack that turn whilst being destroyed. There 
are some examples explicitly mentioned in the final section. For example,
ice elementals in an <b>ice storm</b> and <b>counter-spell</b> or
<b>dispel magic</b> versus all other spells.</p><p>

Another seeming conflict occurs when a target that is resistant to fire has both 
a <b>remove enchantment</b> and <b>fireball</b> cast on them. The enchantment 
is removed as the fireball explodes (since they are simultaneous) hence the poor 
victim is fried. If the target were not resistant to fire and was hit by a 
<b>resist fire</b> and <b>fireball</b> then they would start to resist fire just as 
the fireball exploded and be saved.</p><p>

Before the battle commences, the referee casts a <b>dispel magic</b>
followed by an <b>anti-spell</b> at each of the wizards so they cannot
commence gesturing prematurely in order to nearly finish a spell when they
start the battle. For the same reason, being made resistant to fire in your 
last battle doesn't do you any good in the next.</p><p>

</p><h2>Winning</h2>

	Each wizard can sustain fourteen points of damage but dies when fifteen or 
more points of damage are done. The surviving wizard (if any) is declared the winner. 
Simultaneous death is a posthumous draw. Damage to wizards and monsters is 
cumulative (so you don't have to do it all in one go!).
Dead monsters take no further part in the game.<p>
Wizards may also choose to surrender. This is not a spell, but a pair of P gestures 
made by both hands at the same time signals your surrender. See the final section for 
details.</p><p>

</p><h2>Spells</h2>
	Below you will find a list of spells (plus <b>surrender</b>),
what they do, how long they last, and the series of gestures used to cast them. <p>
In the notation used for gesture series, upper case letters are used as abbreviations 
except when two simultaneous single-handed gestures are required. In those
cases an open bracket followed by a lower case letter (e.g. (w ) will be used instead. </p><p>
Finally there is a short list of spells in forward and reverse order, 
intended for use as a reference sheet for  players during the battle. 
To see if a spell has been cast, look up in the  reverse section the last gesture and follow back.</p><p>


</p><h2>Protection Spells</h2>

<h3>Shield</h3>
gesture P. This spell protects the subject from all attacks from monsters (that
is, creatures created by a summonning spell), from missile spells, and from 
stabs by wizards. The shield will block any number of such attacks but lasts for 
only one round. The shield protects the subject on the turn in which it is cast.<p>

</p><h3>Remove enchantment</h3>
gestures P-D-W-P. Terminates the effects of all <b>Enchantment Spells</b> 
that have been cast on the subject including those that are cast on the subject at 
the same time as the  <b>remove enchantment</b>. Effects which have already
passed are not reversed. For example, the victim of a <b>blindness</b> spell would
not be able to see what their opponent's gestures were on the the <b>blindness</b> 
is removed. Note that all enchantments are removed and the caster may not pick
and choose. <b>Remove enchantment</b> also destroys any monster upon which
it is cast, although the monster can attack in that turn. Wizards suffer no
adverse effects from this spell, aside from the removal of their enchantments.

<h3>Magic Mirror</h3>
gestures C-(w. Any spell cast on a subject protected by this spell is reflected back 
upon the caster of that spell. The <b>magic mirror</b> protects only during
the turn in which it was cast. The protection includes spells like <b>missile</b>
and <b>lightning bolt</b> but does not include attacks by monsters or stabs from 
wizards.<p>
The mirror does not affect spells which are cast upon oneself (e.g. spells from this 
section and the <b>Summonning</b> section). The mirror is countered totally
if either a <b>counter-spell</b> or <b>dispel magic</b> are cast on the subject
in the same turn as the mirror. The mirror has no effect on spells which affect 
more than one person (such as <b>fire storm</b>). Two mirrors cast at one subject 
simultaneously combine to form a single mirror.</p><p>

</p><h3>Counter-spell</h3>
gestures W-P-P <strong>or</strong> W-W-S. Any other spell cast upon the subject 
in the same turn has no effect. In the case of blanket spells, which affect 
more than one person, the subject of the <b>counter-spell</b> alone is protected.<p>
For example, a <b>fire storm</b> spell could kill off a monster but not if 
a <b>counter-spell</b> were cast on the monster in the same turn. Everyone else 
would be affected as usual by the <b>fire storm</b> unless they had their own 
protection. The <b>counter-spell</b> will cancel all the spells cast at the subject 
for that turn (including <b>remove enchantment</b> and <b>magic mirror</b>) except <b>dispel magic</b> 
and <b>finger of death</b>. It will combine with another spell of its own type for the same 
effect as if it were alone. The <b>counter-spell</b> will also act as a <b>shield</b> on 
the final gesture in addition to its other properties, but the shield effect is on 
the same subject as its other effect.

</p><h3>Dispel Magic</h3>
gestures C-D-P-W. This spell acts as a combination of <b>counter-spell</b> and 
<b>remove enchantment</b>, but its effects are universal rather than limited to the 
subject of the spell. It will stop any spell cast in the same turn from working
(apart from another dispel magic spell which combines with it for the same 
result), and will remove all enchantments from all beings before they have 
effect. In addition, all monsters are destroyed although they can attack that
turn. <b>Counter-spells</b> and <b>magic mirrors</b> have no effect. The spell will not 
work on stabs or surrenders. As with a <b>counter-spell</b> it also acts as a 
<b>shield</b> for its subject.

<h3>Raise Dead</h3>
gestures D-W-W-F-W-C. The subject of this spell is usually a recently-dead 
(not yet decomposing) human corpse though it may be used on a dead monster. When
the spell is cast, life returns to the corpse and all damage is cured.
All enchantments are also removed (as per the spell) so any <b>diseases</b> or 
<b>poisons</b> will be neutralized and all other enchantments removed. 
If swords, knives, or other implements of destruction still remain in the corpse 
when it is raised, they will of course cause it damage as usual. The subject will 
be able to act normally immediately after the spell is cast. On the turn
a monster is raised it may attack. Wizards may begin gesturing on the turn following
their return from the dead.<p>
This is the only spell which affects corpses. It therefore 
cannot be stopped by a <b>counter-spell</b>. A <b>dispel magic</b> 
spell will prevent its effect, since <b>dispel magic</b> affects all spells 
no matter what their subject.</p><p>
If the spell is cast on a live individual, the effect is that of a <b>cure light 
wounds</b> recovering five points of damage, or as many as have been sustained if less
than five. Note that any diseases the live subject might have are <em>not</em> cured.</p><p>

</p><h3>Cure Light Wounds</h3>
gestures D-F-W. If the subject has received damage then he is cured by one point
as if that point had not been inflicted.<p>
Thus, for example, if a wizard was at  ten points of damage and was hit simultaneously 
by a <b>cure light wounds</b> and a <b>lightning bolt</b> he would finish that turn on 
fourteen points rather than fifteen (or nine if there had been no 
<b>lightning bolt</b>).</p><p>
The effect is not removed by a <b>dispel  magic</b> or <b>remove enchantment</b>.</p><p>

</p><h3>Cure Heavy Wounds</h3>
gestures D-F-P-W. This spell is similar to <b>cure light wounds</b> in effect
but two points of damage are cured. Note that only one point is cured if only
one point of damage has been sustained and the spell has no effect if the subject
is completely undamaged.<p>
This spell will also cure any diseases the subject might have at the time.</p><p>


</p><h2>Summonning Spells</h2>

<h3>Summon Goblin</h3>
gestures S-F-W. This spell creates a goblin under the control of the subject 
upon whom the spell is cast (or if cast on a monster, the subject monster's
<em>controller</em>, even if the monster later dies or changes loyalty). The goblin 
can attack immediately and its victim can be any any wizard or other monster the 
controller desires, stating which at the time he writes his gestures. It does one 
point of damage to its victim per turn and is destroyed after one point of damage 
is inflicted upon it.<p>
The summoning spell cannot be cast at an elemental, and if cast at something
which doesn't exist, the spell has no effect.</p><p>

</p><h3>Summon Ogre</h3>
gestures P-S-F-W. This spell is the same as <b>summon goblin</b> but the ogre
created inflicts and is destroyed by two points of damage rather than one.<p>

</p><h3>Summon Troll</h3>
gestures F-P-S-F-W. This spell is the same as <b>summon goblin</b> but the troll
created inflicts and is destroyed by three points of damage rather than one.<p>

</p><h3>Summon Giant</h3> 
gestures W-F-P-S-F-W. This spell is the same as <b>summon goblin</b> but the giant
created inflicts and is destroyed by four points of damage rather than one.<p>

</p><h3>Summon Elemental</h3>
gestures C-S-W-W-S. This spell creates either a fire elemental or an ice 
elemental at the discretion of the person upon whom the spell is cast after he 
has seen all the gestures made that turn. Elementals must be cast at someone 
and cannot be "shot off" harmlessly at some inanimate object.<p>

The elemental will, for that turn and until destroyed,
attack everyone who is not resistant to its type (heat or cold), causing three 
points of damage per turn. The elemental takes three points of damage to be killed 
but may be destroyed by spells of the opposite type (e.g. <b>fire storm</b>, <b>resist
cold</b> or <b>fireball</b> will kill an ice elemental), and will also neutralize the 
canceling spell. Elementals will not attack on the turn they are destroyed by 
such a spell. An elemental will also be engulfed and destroyed by a storm of its
own type but, in such an event, the storm is not neutralized although the 
elemental still does not attack in that turn. Two elementals of the opposite type
will also destroy each other before attacking, and two of the same type will join
together to form a single elemental of normal strength. Note that only wizards
or monsters resistant to the type of elemental, or who are casting a spell
which has the effect of a <b>shield</b> do not get attacked by the elemental. 
Casting a <b>fireball</b> upon yourself when being attacked by an ice elemental is 
no defence! (Cast it at the elemental...)</p><p>


</p><h2>Damaging Spells</h2>

<h3>Missile</h3>
gestures S-D. This spell creates a material object of hard substance which is
hurled towards the subject of the spell and causes him one point of damage. The 
spell is thwarted by a <b>shield</b> in addition to the usual <b>counter-spell</b>, 
<b>dispel magic</b> and <b>magic mirror</b> (the latter causing it to hit whoever 
cast it instead).<p>

</p><h3>Finger of Death</h3> 
gestures P-W-P-F-S-S-S-D. Kills the subject stone dead. This spell is so
powerful that it is unaffected by a <b>counter-spell</b> although a <b>dispel magic</b>
spell cast upon the final gesture will stop it. The usual way to prevent being 
harmed by this spell is to disrupt it during casting using, for example, an 
<b>anti-spell</b>.<p>

</p><h3>Lightning Bolt</h3>
gestures D-F-F-D-D <strong>or</strong> W-D-D-C. The subject of this spell is hit by a bolt of
lightning and sustains five points of damage. Resistance to heat or cold is 
irrelevant. There are two gesture combinations for the spell, but the shorter one
may be used only once per day (i.e. per battle) by any wizard. The longer one
may be used without restriction. A <b>shield</b> spell offers no defence.<p>

</p><h3>Cause Light Wounds</h3> 
gestures W-F-P. The subject of this spell is inflicted with two points of damage.
Resistance to heat or cold offers no defence. A simultaneous <b>cure light wounds</b>
will serve only to reduce the damage to 1 point. A <b>shield</b> has no effect.<p>

</p><h3>Cause Heavy Wounds</h3> 
gestures W-P-F-D. This has the same effect as <b>cause light wounds</b> but inflicts
three points of damage instead of two.<p>
 
</p><h3>Fireball</h3>
gestures F-S-S-D-D. The subject of this spell is hit by a ball of fire and 
sustains five points of damage unless he is resistant to fire. If at the same time
an <b>ice storm</b> prevails, the subject of the <b>fireball</b> is instead not harmed by
either spell, although the storm will affect others as normal. If directed at
an ice elemental, the fireball will destroy it before it can attack, but has no
other effect on the creatures.<p>

</p><h3>Fire Storm</h3>
gestures S-W-W-C. Everything not resistant to heat sustains 5 points of damage 
that turn. The spell cancels wholly, causing no damage, with either an <b>ice
storm</b> or an ice elemental. It will destroy but not be destroyed by a fire 
elemental. Two <b>fire storms</b> act as one.<p>

</p><h3>Ice Storm</h3>
gestures W-S-S-C. Everything not resistant to cold sustains 5 points of damage 
that turn. The spell cancels wholly, causing no damage, with either a <b>fire
storm</b> or a fire elemental, and will cancel locally with a <b>fireball</b>. It will 
destroy but not be destroyed by an ice elemental. Two <b>ice storms</b> act as one.<p>


</p><h2>Enchantment Spells</h2>

<h3>Amnesia</h3>
gestures D-P-P. If the subject of this spell is a wizard, next turn he must 
repeat identically the gestures he made in the current turn, including stabs.
If the subject is a monster it will attack whoever it attacked this turn. If
the subject is simultaneously the subject of any of <b>confusion</b>, <b>charm person</b>,
<b>charm monster</b>, <b>paralysis</b> or <b>fear</b> then none of the spells work.<p>

</p><h3>Confusion</h3>
gestures D-S-F. If the subject of this spell is a wizard, next turn he writes 
down his gestures as usual and after exposing them, rolls 2 dice to determine
which gesture is superseded due to his being confused. The first die indicates
left hand on 1-3, right on 4-6. The second roll determines what the gesture for
that hand shall be replaced with: 1=C, 2=D, 3=F, 4=P, 5=S, 6=W. If the subject 
of the spell is a monster, it attacks at random that turn. If the subject is 
also the subject of any of: <b>amnesia</b>, <b>charm person</b>, <b>charm monster</b>, 
<b>paralysis</b> or <b>fear</b>, none of the spells work.<p>

</p><h3>Charm Person</h3>
gestures P-S-D-F. Except for cancellation with other enchantments, this spell
only affects humans. The subject is told which of his hands will be controlled
at the time the spell hits, and in the following turn, the caster of the spell
writes down the gesture he wants the subject's named hand to perform. This could
be a stab or nothing. If the subject is only so because of a reflection from a 
<b>magic mirror</b> the subject of the mirror assumes the role of caster and writes
down his opponent's gesture. If the subject is also the subject of any of 
<b>amnesia</b>, <b>confusion</b>, <b>charm monster</b>, <b>paralysis</b> or <b>fear</b>, none of the 
spells work.<p>

</p><h3>Charm Monster</h3>
gestures P-S-D-D. Except for cancellation with other enchantments, this spell 
only affects monsters (excluding elementals). Control of the monster is
transferred to the caster of the spell (or retained by him) as of this turn,
i.e. the monster will attack whosoever its new controller dictates from that 
turn onwards including that turn. Further charms are, of course, possible,
transferring as before. If the subject of the charm is also the subject of any 
of: <b>amnesia</b>, <b>confusion</b>, <b>charm person</b>, <b>fear</b> or <b>paralysis</b>, none of the 
spells work.<p>

</p><h3>Paralysis</h3>
gestures F-F-F. If the subject of the spell is a wizard, then on the turn the 
spell is cast, after gestures have been revealed, the caster selects one of the
wizard's hands and on the next turn that hand is paralyzed into the position
it is in this turn. If the wizard already had a paralyzed hand, it must be the 
same hand which is paralyzed again. Certain gestures remain the same but if the
hand being paralyzed is performing a C, S or W it is instead paralyzed into F, 
D or P respectively, otherwise it will remain in the position written down (this
allows repeated stabs). A favourite ploy is to continually paralyze a hand 
(F-F-F-F-F-F etc.) into a non-P gesture and then set a monster on the subject 
so that he has to use his other hand to protect himself, but then has no defence
against other magical attacks. If the subject of the spell is a monster 
(excluding elementals which are unaffected) it simply does not attack in the 
turn following the one in which the spell was cast. If the subject of the spell
is also the subject of any of <b>amnesia</b>, <b>confusion</b>, <b>charm person</b>, <b>charm 
monster</b> or <b>fear</b>, none of the spells work.<p>

</p><h3>Fear</h3>
gestures S-W-D. In the turn following the casting of this spell, the subject
cannot perform a C, D, F or S gesture. This obviously has no effect on monsters.
If the subject is also the subject of <b>amnesia</b>, <b>confusion</b>, <b>charm person</b>, 
<b>charm monster</b> or <b>paralysis</b>, then none of the spells work.<p>

</p><h3>Anti-spell</h3>
gestures S-P-F. On the turn following the casting of this spell, the subject 
cannot include any gestures made on or before this turn in a spell sequence 
and must restart a new spell from the beginning of that spell sequence. The 
spell does not affect spells which are cast on the same turn nor does it affect
monsters.<p>

</p><h3>Protection from Evil</h3>
gestures W-W-P. For this turn and the following 3 turns the subject of this 
spell is protected as if using a <b>shield</b> spell, thus leaving both hands free. 
Concurrent <b>shield</b> spells offer no further protection and compound <b>protection 
from evil</b> spells merely overlap offering no extra cover.<p>

</p><h3>Resist Heat</h3>
gestures W-W-F-P. The subject of this spell becomes totally resistant to all 
forms of heat attack (<b>fireball</b>, <b>fire storm</b> and fire elementals). Only 
<b>dispel magic</b> or <b>remove enchantment</b> will terminate this resistance once 
started (although a <b>counter-spell</b> will prevent it from working if cast at the
subject at the same time as this spell). A <b>resist heat</b> cast directly on a 
fire elemental will destroy it before it can attack that turn, but there is no 
effect on ice elementals.<p>

</p><h3>Resist Cold</h3>
gestures S-S-F-P. The effects of this spell are identical to <b>resist heat</b> but 
resistance is to cold (<b>ice storm</b> and ice elementals) and it destroys ice 
elementals if they are the subject of the spell but doesn't affect fire 
elementals.<p>

</p><h3>Disease</h3>
gestures D-S-F-F-F-C. The subject of this spell immediately contracts a deadly 
(non-contagious) disease which will kill him at the end of 6 turns counting
from the one upon which the spell is cast. The malady is cured by <b>remove
enchantment</b> or <b>cure heavy wounds</b> or <b>dispel magic</b> in the meantime.<p>

</p><h3>Poison</h3>
gestures D-W-W-F-W-D. This is the same as the disease spell except that <b>cure
heavy wounds</b> does not stop its effects.<p>

</p><h3>Blindness</h3>
gestures D-W-F-F-(d. For the next 3 turns not including the one in which the 
spell was cast, the subject is unable to see. If he is a wizard, he cannot tell
what his opponent's gestures are, although he must be informed of any which 
affect him (e.g. summons spells, <b>missile</b> etc cast at him) but not <b>counter-
spells</b> to his own attacks. Indeed he will not know if his own spells work 
unless they also affect him (e.g. a <b>fire storm</b> when he isn't resistant to 
fire.) He can control his monsters (e.g. "Attack whatever it was that just 
attacked me"). Blinded monsters are instantly destroyed and cannot attack in 
that turn.<p>

</p><h3>Invisibility</h3>
gestures P-P-(w-(s. This spell is similar to <b>blindness</b> only the subject of the
spell becomes invisible to his opponent and his monsters. All spells he creates,
though not gestures, can be seen by his opponent and identified. The subject 
cannot be attacked by any monsters although they can be directed at him in case 
he becomes visible prematurely. Wizards can still stab and direct spells at him,
with the same hope. Any monster made invisible is destroyed due to the unstable 
nature of such magically created creatures.<p>

</p><h3>Haste</h3>
gestures P-W-P-W-W-C. For the next 3 turns, the subject (but not his monsters
if a wizard) makes an extra set of gestures due to being speeded up. This takes
effect in the following turn so that instead of giving one pair of gestures, 2
are given, the effect of both being taken simultaneously at the end of the turn.
Thus a single <b>counter-spell</b> from his adversary could cancel 2 spells cast by 
the hastened wizard on 2 half-turns if the phasing is right. Non-hastened
wizards and monsters can see everything the hastened individual is doing. 
Hastened monsters can change target in the extra turns if desired.<p>

</p><h3>Time stop</h3>
gestures S-P-P-C. The subject of this spell immediately takes an extra turn, on
which no-one can see or know about unless they are harmed. All non-affected 
beings have no resistance to any form of attack, e.g. a wizard halfway through 
the duration of a <b>protection from evil</b> spell can be harmed by a monster which 
has had its time stopped. Time-stopped monsters attack whoever their controller
instructs, and time-stopped elementals affect everyone, resistance to heat or
cold being immaterial in that turn.<p>

</p><h3>Delayed effect</h3>
gestures D-W-S-S-S-P. This spell only works if cast upon a wizard. The next 
spell he completes, provided it is on this turn or one of the next 3 is "banked"
until needed, i.e. it fails to work until its caster desires. This next spell
which is to be banked does not include the actual spell doing the banking. The
spell must be written down to be used by its caster at the same time that he 
writes his gestures. Note that spells banked are those cast by the subject not 
those cast at him. If he casts more than one spell at the same time he chooses 
which is to be banked. Remember that P is a <b>shield</b> spell, and surrender is 
not a spell. A wizard may only have one spell banked at any one time.<p>

</p><h3>Permanency</h3>
gestures S-P-F-P-S-D-W. This spell only works if cast upon a wizard. The next 
spell he completes, provided it is on this turn or one of the next 3, and 
which falls into the category of "Enchantments" (except <b>anti-spell</b>, <b>disease</b>,
<b>poison</b>, or <b>time-stop</b>) will have its effect made permanent. This means that
the effect of the extended spell on the first turn of its duration is repeated 
eternally. For example, a <b>confusion</b> spell will be the same gesture rather than
re-rolling the dice, a <b>charm person</b> will mean repetition of the chosen 
gesture, etc. If the subject of the <b>permanency</b> casts more than one spell at 
the same time eligible for permanency, he chooses which has its duration 
extended. Note that the person who has his spell made permanent does not 
necessarily have to make himself the subject of the spell. A <b>permanency</b> spell
cannot increase its own duration, nor the duration of spells saved by a <b>delayed
effect</b> (so if both a <b>permanency</b> and <b>delayed effect</b> are eligible for the 
same spell to be banked or extended, a choice must be made, the losing
spell being neutralized and working on the next spell instead).<p>


</p><h2>Non-spells</h2>

<h3>Surrender</h3> 
gestures (p. This is not a spell and consequently cannot be cast at anyone. The
wizard making these gestures, irrespective of whether they terminate spells or 
not, surrenders and the contest is over. The surrendering wizard is deemed to 
have lost unless his gestures completed spells which killed his opponent. Two 
simultaneous surrenders count as a draw. It is a skill for wizards to work their
spells so that they never accidentally perform 2 P gestures simultaneously. 
Wizards can be killed as they surrender if hit with appropriate spells or 
attacked physically, but the "referees" will cure any diseases, poisons etc 
immediately after the surrender for them.<p>

</p><h3>Stab</h3>
gesture stab. This is not a spell but an attack which can be directed at any 
individual monster or wizard. Unless protected in that turn by a <b>shield</b> spell 
or another spell with the same effect, the being stabbed suffers 1 point of
damage. The wizard only has one knife so can only stab with one hand in any 
turn, although which hand doesn't matter. The stab cannot be reflected by a 
<b>magic mirror</b> or stopped by <b>dispel magic</b> (although its <b>shield</b> effect 
*could* stop the stab). Wizards are not allowed to stab themselves and must
choose a target for the stab. Knives cannot be thrown.<p>

<h3>Annotation</h3>

1. Black starts with 2 W's hoping to use the left as a possible W-W-S <b>counter-
spell</b> in the event of White opening with an attack, or as a possible W-W-F-P 
<b>resist heat</b> spell. His right hand also opens for a possible <b>counter-spell</b> 
or W-P-F-D <b>cause heavy wounds</b> if White has no possible attack; the second P 
will also cover against any S-D <b>missile attack</b>. 
White has the same ideas for his left hand as Black and opens with a P for his 
right hand in case Black tries a stab, leading to P-D-W-P <b>remove enchantment</b>
hopefully.<p>

2. Both complete their second gestures as intended and both notice that neither
can use an offensive spell on the third turn so they can switch their left 
hands to W-W-F-P <b>resist fire</b>. Black notices that the only spell White could 
be preparing with his right hand is remove enchantment and hence his own <b>resist
fire</b> would be canceled. Since he cannot adjust his right hand sequence to 
produce a <b>counter-spell</b> he resolves to use his latest W to start a W-D-D-C 
<b>lightning bolt</b>.</p><p>

3. White had to continue his <b>remove enchantment</b> in case Black called his bluff
but now knows it is pointless to continue as there will be nothing to cancel. 
Black is certain to hit White with an unstoppable <b>cause heavy wounds</b> next time
but notices too late that, had he instead of gesturing a D with his left hand,
gestured a W, he could have cast a W-W-S <b>counter-spell</b> at White and stopped 
his <b>resist heat</b> from working. However, he has a <b>lightning bolt</b> coming as 
compensation...</p><p>

4. Black hits White with his <b>cause heavy wounds</b> and White becomes fire-
resistant. White notes that had he gone ahead with his <b>remove enchantment</b> 
spell he would have been doing two P gestures this turn - surrendering! Instead 
he performs a W with his right hand to time a <b>counter-spell</b> after Black's 
last continuation.</p><p>

5. Black aborts his <b>lightning bolt</b> spell, but White still follows through 
with his <b>counter-spell</b>, just in case. Black switches to the other combination 
for <b>lightning bolt</b>, D-F-F-D-D and sneaks in the start of an amnesia D-P-P. 
White commences a <b>summon ogre</b> P-S-F-W with his left hand, but upon seeing that
next time he will be struck by <b>amnesia</b> realizes that he won't be able to
continue it. Knowing the nature of the spell, he decides to switch next time to
a spell starting off with 2 identical gestures, a W-W-S <b>counter-spell</b> for 
safety.</p><p>

6. Black hits White with the predicted D-P-P amnesia spell, meaning that White 
must repeat his gestures next time with the same hands. White knows that he 
has a "free" S-D <b>missile</b> on Black since Black cannot do a P shield to defend 
himself or he would be performing the <b>surrender</b> gestures.</p><p>

7. Since Black knows White's gestures, he can tell that White will be able to
time a <b>counter-spell</b> to ward off the proposed <b>lightning bolt</b> D-F-F-D-D, so 
he changes to a <b>fireball</b> F-S-S-D-D. However, White is resistant to fire so a 
P-D-W-P <b>remove enchantment</b> is called for from the right hand.</p><p>

8. White surprised Black by repeating his W gesture in the left hand so he can
now time a counter spell for the next round and thus prevent the <b>remove 
enchantment</b> from affecting his fire invulnerability (although his resistance to
fire will be unaffected by the <b>counter-spell</b> since he has already cast the
spell on himself in round 4). With his right hand, White half-heartedly starts
off a <b>confusion</b> spell to interrupt Black next time.</p><p>

9. Black does 2 F gestures having to change in mid-spells after White's cunning
gestures last round. He decides to go for a <b>blindness</b> spell D-W-F-F-(d with 
his right hand, and for <b>cold resistance</b> S-S-F-P with his left, to cut his 
losses. White casts the counter spell W-W-S on himself so that his <b>confusion</b> 
D-S-F will work on Black.</p><p>

10. Black writes down P for his left hand and F for his right, and White writes 
D and W. Since Black was hit by a <b>confusion</b> last time one of his gestures 
will be affected. He rolls a C on the right hand and this supersedes the F he
had written down. Since he didn't C with his other hand and C is a 2-handed
gesture, it counts as a null. Note that if he had rolled for a P he would
have surrendered. White finishes off a <b>summon goblin</b> spell S-F-W, and a
<b>missile</b> S-D. Black's left hand finishes a <b>resist cold</b> S-S-F-P but he decides
to use only the last gesture as a P <b>shield</b> so that neither of White's attacks 
harm him. Now he will wish to dispose of the goblin as soon as possible so he 
can stop performing P's to protect himself.</p><p>

11. Black stabs the goblin and, since only 1 hit is required to kill it, 
eliminates it. He also gestures a P <b>shield</b> so that it cannot harm him in that 
turn. White gestures for an <b>amnesia</b> D-P-P and a <b>lightning bolt</b> W-D-D-C
(the sort which can only be used once per wizard). He also performed a P
<b>shield</b> but didn't notice and since it is in the "protection" section it was 
cast upon himself. If he had cast it at the goblin it wouldn't have been killed.
Black realizes that he will have no defence against either of White's 
forthcoming attacks, so chooses to work 2 spells beginning with the same
gesture next time so that the amnesia won't be too damaging.</p><p>

12. Black must start off both gestures from scratch after the stab and half-C 
and opts for P-P-(w-(s <b>invisibility</b> and <b>resist cold</b> S-S-F-P. White's 
<b>amnesia</b> spell is completed so Black must repeat next time as expected.</p><p>

13. Black repeats, and White does a C gesture with both hands to terminate a
W-D-D-C <b>lightning bolt</b> giving 5 points of damage to Black. White cannot cast 
another <b>lightning bolt</b> using the same gestures now, even if he does W-D-D-C
since this type is allowed only once per battle. However, he may use the
alternate gestures if he desires.</p><p>

14. Black aborts his right-hand spell since a W with both hands is needed for
the <b>invisibility</b>. White does 2 S gestures, hoping for a C-S-W-W-S <b>summon
elemental</b> and either an <b>anti-spell</b> S-F-F or <b>summon goblin</b> S-F-W.</p><p>

15. Black goes invisible for the next 3 turns so White won't be able to see his
gestures. White continues with his <b>summon elemental</b> but has the option to 
change to a <b>fire storm</b> sequence if he so desires.</p><p>

16. Realizing that he is about to be hit by an <b>anti-spell</b> S-P-F from White, 
Black opens up with 2 <b>missiles</b> S-D and catches White off guard. Next time 
Black must gesture from scratch again. Although White does not see Black's
gestures he knows he has been hit by 2 <b>missiles</b> so can work them out.</p><p>

17. For the second time, Black starts up for a <b>lightning bolt</b> W-D-D-C, hoping 
this time to complete it, and a covering <b>anti-spell</b> S-P-F so that White will 
be unable to defend himself from it. Meanwhile White realizes he is resistant 
to fire and unleashes a <b>fire storm</b> giving 5 points of damage to all those not 
fire-resistant which just happens to be Black.</p><p>

18. White does 2 S gestures again hoping to fool Black into thinking that he 
will repeat the sequence he used after the last C gesture, whereas he intends to
hit out with 2 S-D <b>missiles</b> next turn (when Black becomes visible again). 
Black continues with his plan.</p><p>

19. Black is surprised by the 2 <b>missiles</b> from White and is not performing a 
P <b>shield</b> which would protect him. White is hit by Black's <b>anti-spell</b> S-P-F
but is unaware of the impending <b>lightning bolt</b> anyway...</p><p>

20. Black hits White with his <b>lightning bolt</b> as White prepares 2 more 
<b>missiles</b> which would kill Black if they hit, but, noting Black's C he daren't 
risk the possibility of it being followed by a pair of W's for a C-(w <b>magic 
mirror</b> which would reflect them back at White. Hence White decides to go for 
another <b>anti-spell</b> and <b>fire storm</b>.</p><p>

21. Black does perform the 2 W's planning to <b>cause heavy wounds</b> or defend with
<b>counter-spell</b>. White continues as planned and Black becomes aware that he is
about to be burned to death.</p><p>

22. Resigning himself to defeat Black surrenders just as White's <b>anti-spell</b> 
hits him. The battle ends before White can make the final C gesture which would 
have disposed of his enemy. White wins the contest.</p><p>
