Subject: FFF/FoD Analysis by The_Shadow

The_Shadow speaks:
<p>
Here is an updated reposting of a long note that I sent out in May. It was
in response to the FFF/FoD debate. At the time it seemed like everyone
that I played was opening with P F and trying to score a quick kill. Also,
a variation of FFF/FoD was just starting to go around that opened with
FFFF/SPFP.  This took advantage of the "is it a bug or a feature" property
of continuously paralyzing your opponent's hand to "-", letting you segue
into FFF/FoD with your opponent at a great disadvantage. You can ALWAYS
break FFF/FoD when it is used as an opening as long as you react quickly
enough. Here are some ways to do it for any opening move. 

<HR WIDTH=80%>

I like to think of FM as a fencing match and a good grasp of timing is
essential to winning duels. FoD is a very powerful, very long spell and
using it is like using a broadsword in a fencing match. If you hit with it
you win automatically, but it takes a long time to swing. 
<p>
The combination of FoD and FFF is tough to beat, but it CAN be beaten, 
particularly if your opponent uses it as an opening move. I admit that I 
have used this combination to win many games, but I must also say that 
many people have tried to use it against me as well. I have not yet lost 
a game to FoD/FFF (I have lost to just FoD, though. It teaches you to pay
attention!). Why? Timing. FoD/FFF is best used in the midgame when 
your opponent is busy doing something else. If you can sneak in the first 
few moves unnoticed then the combination is difficult to beat. Most 
people that I have played against have used it in their opening, hoping 
for a quick kill. FoD/FFF can ALWAYS be stopped as an opening, you just 
have to react quickly. 
<p>
Since I never open with FoD/FFF and am tired of playing people that do,
here are some absolutely guaranteed ways of beating the FoD/FFF opening.
Hopefully this will help stomp out the FoD/FFF opening. In all cases you
make whatever opening you like and your opponent opens with P F. You
immediately start a defense against the FoD/FFF combo: 
<pre>
OPPONENT:

RH: PWPFSSSD
LH: FFFFFFFF

YOU (Question marks are wild cards and can be any gesture):

IF YOUR OPENING INCLUDES A D:

LH: DPPSPFP
RH: ?FFFFFF
</pre>
Cast amnesia on your opponent in turn 3. If it hits, you have broken the
FoD. If your opponent paralyzes himself to cancel the amnesia then
continuously paralyze yourself on turns 4-7 and land the anti spell on
turn 7 to break the FoD. 
<pre>
IF YOUR OPENING INCLUDES AN S:

RH: SWDSPFP
LH: ?FFFFFF
</pre>
This is similar to the "D" defense described above. Cast fear on your
opponent on turn 3. If that doesn't work, paralyze yourself in turns 4-7
and hit with the anti spell. 
<pre>
IF YOUR OPENING INCLUDES AN F:

RH: FFFFF
LH: ?SPFP
</pre>
Paralyze yourself on turns 3-5. Hit with the anti spell on turn 5 and the
FoD is broken.
<pre>
IF YOUR OPENING INCLUDES A W:

RH: WWSPFP
LH: ?FFFFF
</pre>
Cast the counter spell on yourself in turn 3 and paralyze yourself 
continuously on turns 4-5, landing the anti spell on turn 6 and breaking 
the FoD.
<pre>
IF YOUR OPENING INCLUDES A P:
</pre>
You didn't open P P so use your other gesture and one of the strategies 
listed above.
<pre>
IF YOUR OPENING WAS P >, - -, OR C C:

RH: CFFSPPC(W)
LH: CFFFFFC(W)
</pre>
This one is pretty esoteric, I include it for completeness and because it 
shows a way to use time stop to defend against FoD. For these openings 
you basically forget your opening move so this defense will work with any 
opening. You will be paralyzed in turn 3. Submit your orders for turn 4 
as RH S LH S. One hand will be paralyzed to F and the other will be an S.
If you are not paralyzed for some reason in turn 3 just submit RH S, LH F.
Paralyze yourself on turn 4. On turn 5 you can paralyze either yourself 
or your opponent since you will repeat your gestures anyway. On turn 6 
paralyze your opponent. If it hits you have turned the FoD into a 
fireball. Unfortunately you will most likely be paralyzed by your 
opponent since he didn't paralyze himself and you won't be able to defend 
against the fireball, but it is better than instant death. More likely, 
your opponent will paralyze himself in turn 6 to protect his FoD. In that 
case you clap on turn 7, casting time stop on yourself in turn 7. You 
immediately get an extra turn that is UNAFFECTED by any spells cast by 
your opponent. So even if your opponent paralyzes you in turn 7 you are 
unaffected by it in your time stopped turn. Use your time stopped turn to 
gesture W W and you will have a magic mirror in place on turn 8. One of 
your hands will then be paralyzed into a P from the W's gestured in your 
time stopped turn. The magic mirror will reflect the FoD.
<p>
Another variation on the FoD/FFF opening is the anti spell/FFF/FoD attack:
<pre>
OPPONENT:

RH: SPFPWPFSSSD
LH: FFFFFFFFFFF
</pre>
This can be a nasty opening. If your opponent hits you with paralysis and 
anti spell at the same time, then the gesture that gets paralyzed is '-'. 
The key to defending against this opening is to counter spell the anti 
spell. Here is a defense that can be used with any set of opening gestures:
<pre>
YOU:

RH: ?WPPSPFP
LH: ??FFFFFF
</pre>
Counter spell yourself in turn 4 and paralyze yourself turns 5-7. Then
land the anti spell in turn 8, breaking the FoD that would have been
completed in turn 11. The fun part about this defense is that if your
opponent lets you land the anti spell you are in position to use the same
anti spell/FFF/FoD attack on him. 
<p>
I hope that I have made my point. FFF/FoD can easily be defended as an 
opening. It is still effective in the midgame, though. But now it becomes 
just another midgame strategy that you have to be on the look out against.
It adds a bit of danger to the game and makes it more interesting in my 
opinion. The game does not degenerate into a contest of who can use it 
first, it requires a good sense of timing and misdirection to pull it off 
successfully. After all, a good fencer can score a lot of hits on you 
with his rapier and still get away while you are slowly swinging your 
broadsword.
<p>
A last comment. If it is decided that FoD/FFF is too powerful and that 
something must be changed I would recommend that the paralysis targeting 
rules be left alone. People complain that paralysis is too strong. I 
disagree. If you continually paralyze your opponent with one hand you are 
effectively losing the use of your paralyzing hand as well. It leaves 
both of you with only one hand actively casting useful spells. The main 
advantage to the paralyzer is that you can break it anytime you want to. 
But there are many ways to defend against this sort of attack so I would 
suggest leaving paralysis alone. The easiest change to make that would 
rid the game of the lovely FFF/FoD attack is to allow FoD to be counter 
spelled. Then all you need to do is make one of your gestures a W on turn 
6. Even if it gets paralyzed it paralyzes to P so you can cast WPP and 
counter spell the FoD. This would make FoD less popular, but if you can't 
protect FoD with FFF then its popularity will suffer anyway.

(Janitor's Note: On the Main Server, paralysis has changed so that any other
enchantment overpowers it.  This seems to work pretty well.)
