And finally...man moons later I read these images that I asked for.  Why the delay? Because of lack of interest? No. Because of boredom with This? No.  Some lack of love or caring? No.

Just this, which I have just realized in reading it: for a variety of reasons I just did not have the spiritual/mental energy to be rocked like I knew this would...to connect to this level.  Does that make sense?

So, I wonder how these images still strike you...how this has played out in the months following...through the end of '06, through the holidays, into the New Year....read below for more commentary/questions.

    Dearest Rhazes,

    Here are (the first) sixteen images for you.

    1.  A rental car means to me: research time.  I love rental cars.
    They have so far always been better and faster than the car I'm
    actually driving, lol.  And have better stereo systems.  And on the
    stereo systems I get to tune in to new cities, see what kind of flavor
    they have, see what kind of music they're playing.  LOUD.  So, it
    didn't have to be a convertible for this rental car to be wonderful.
    I get in and it means freedom, it means I'm doing what I want to do,
    it means having learned how to drive well, very well; it means having
    learned how to navigate my way around anywhere, even though I have
    zero directional sense; it means adrenaline (nervousness and
    excitement about the people I'm going to talk to), it means adventure,
    it means serendipity.  This feeling dates from driving around in the
    tri-state area to all the women's homes whom I interviewed for the
    Immaculata book.  It was the worst summer of my life: after the May I
    told Nahum it was off.  I was clinically depressed, not because I was
    without him, but just from the damage. In that rental car I remember
    driving across bridges and thinking how easy it would be to just steer
    this way ever so slightly and go over the edge and die, and really
    thinking about it.  Still, the rental car experience lightened me.  I
    would set my hands on the steering wheel and concentrate on the road
    and go to the next interview and be OK.


Very interesting to me.  Did you know that this is another level that we connect on??!! I, too, love to drive...it releases me...my tensions, ideas, creativity,....energy.  I, too, have often wondered (as recently as Durham last year and drives in Chicago last year) about driving into various bodies of water.  The motorcycle is obviously the umpteenth extension of this...I...can...not...wait for that form of liberation, freedom, openning of senses, exhiliration, etc.

I did not realize until reading this the extent to which your relationship with Nahum affected you.  At some point I want to talk to you about this more...when you are up for it.  If ever.  It is not necessary.
 

    2.  Cindy.  I was thinking on the plane west of how I would describe
    Cindy to you.  She is … a healer.  That captures it.  She is a
    physical therapist and former massage therapist who definitely
    understands her job as her mission in the world.  Met her in Durham
    right after undergrad; she was a few years older than I, friend of
    other friends.  We would run and talk and sometimes make dinner
    together.  Then she moved to Winston-Salem to take a job in a hospital
    there; then she moved to Santa Fe for the rock-climbing and other
    outdoor life possibilities.  I am probably the only non-rock-climbing
    friend she has, lol.  Went to her wedding there last June, which is
    how I found out about the Church of Antioch.  Healer: the listening
    she does.  She is a great listener.  She doesn't judge, about
    anything, ever.  She pursues spirituality outside any religion: still
    a recovering Baptist, she says.  She was one of the people who came to
    stay with me in Fort Worth after I got out of the hospital, after Mary
    left and I still didn't want to be alone.  And when I visited her in
    SF a few months later, one day she just delivered me to a massage
    therapist friend of hers and paid for an hour of work.  It was one of
    those massages that works stuff out of you in such a way that it makes
    you cry.  Which is what I did in her car when she picked me up
    afterward.


This is exactly what my Mother senses about NM...the healing power of the place....because of its spiritual history and legacy and because of the souls that are drawn to it.  Cindy sounds like she was drawn there too...she sounds like a daughter of that place.
 

    3.  The great attractiveness of this group.  These brief words won't
    do justice, but basically the Church of Antioch is a Catholic church
    that maintains apostolic succession (this is the tradition of bishops
    being ordained by the laying-on of hands from generation to generation
    dating to the original twelve apostles), practices the seven
    sacraments, and celebrates Mass.  More broadly, it is liturgically
    conservative, politically/morally liberal, theologically radical, and
    dispositionally esoteric and mystical.  I mean … attractive.  They
    have put together a very good informational DVD that I will send you.

    4.  Liturgically conservative: the Mass is potentially such a
    beautiful ritual, but most Roman Catholic churches don't have a clue
    what to do with it, and it turns into this sterile, mechanical, tawdry
    thing.  But these people do Masses that realize every single moment of
    potential beauty and exploit it to its highest aesthetic and spiritual
    effects.  Incense and music and flow, and many parts of the Mass
    rewritten just so in order to bring out the effect of the words.  And
    not stuffy at all.  There is ad-libbing and humor and laughter, and a
    huge long Kiss of Peace with actual hugging and kissing, and a
    tremendous sense of awe and joy and celebration that accompanies the
    spiritual power they believe is infusing this ritual.  And … you feel
    it.  You feel that spiritual power.  You end up believing, too.  I
    have never felt so potently before that "something was really going
    on" up on that altar.  I don't know exactly what, but … something.

    5.  Attraction: them to me.  Probably a dozen people asked me if I
    would join them, and probably four or five said things to the effect
    that I should consider becoming a priest with them.  I mostly said,
    "I'm supposed to write about you first."  They said, "You can do
    both."  Several times people said this to me as or after they noticed
    I was weeping at parts of the Mass, which I was, at times profusely.

    6.  Attraction: me to them.  Rhazes, a few years ago, as I was leaving
    Texas, I actually told family and friends that I was going to pursue
    ordination—as a Methodist, since that's the church I was in at the
    time.  But I never did anything with it, and then continued to do
    nothing with it in Durham.  Along the way I also largely decided that
    I didn't like the whole idea of being a minister, because I didn't
    know why I couldn't do any teaching I planned on doing in the church
    just as a layperson.  Not everyone who works in the church has to
    freakin' go and be a minister, you know?  And that's still where I am.
    But … this weekend made me think about it again.  Not with any
    desire, but rather just as matter-of-fact ruminations on the topic of
    calling, or fate.


LOL. Before I even got to this image I was feeling it.  The prior writing was so evocative. I could feel every syllable that you wrote.  So naturally, I was thinking, 'this seems like such a passion vein, I wonder if she has ever considered....'  How does this play out now with some of the things that you have been feeling about religion?  One of the great things about my tardiness in this response is that we can revisit these poignant moments with the benefit of time and settling and change.
 

    7.  The digeridoo.  (This is the "what the fuck will happen this time"
    moment.)  So there was a sharing circle of the whole group at the
    beginning ("sharing," ugh, lol!—but great info for me! ;-)), during
    which one of the priests, Dan Dangaran, a Puerto Rican former Jesuit
    ridiculously creative type who now heads up their seminary, played for
    us the digeridoo, which is the huge Australian aboriginal horn.  It's
    made from a tree eaten out by termites so it has many nooks and
    crannies and one person blowing into it makes about three or four
    tones at once.  It was the most fantastical, low, lowing, haunting
    sound.  So afterward I asked Father Dan how he plays it, and he said,
    "Come sit over here and we'll give you a little clearing of the
    chakras."  So I sat down in a chair and held the opening of the horn
    with my hands, which he instructed me to raise up and down my body
    over all the chakra points.  I had to ask where they were, of course!
    Crown of head, third eye, some say an extra one at the thymus (throat
    area), heart, solar plexus, two right and left at the hips and lower,
    and base of spine.  Plus small ones in the palm of each hand, the sole
    of each foot.  So.  As he played the instrument, I closed my eyes and
    raised and lowered the horn so its primal, earthly tones sounded
    vibrations over each of the chakra points, and then before it was done
    I waved each of my hands in front of it, too.  What did I feel.  I
    felt amazed that this was happening and tried not to let thinking and
    self-consciousness ruin the moment.  And I felt tingling, especially
    in my core, like the blood had turned cool and sparkly.  Ahhh.  It was
    done and I asked Dan some more questions and then he was onto someone
    else.  Bishop Patsy—the Tarot card reader from last year—came over to
    me with tears in her eyes.  "You will never be the same, Julie-girl,"
    she said.  "You just got rid of something, some serious junk, right
    here," and she patted the solar plexus chakra.  "I saw it.  I don't
    know what it was." I said, "I don't know what it was either, but I'm
    not thinking about it."  She said, "Don't think about it.  It's gone.
    But, write me an email sometime this year and tell me what it was."


I am familiar with the digeridoo.  I was introduced to it when I discovered one of my favorite music groups Jamiroquai (although, I have not listened to their latest stuff).  Anyway, the sound of that instrument is almost preternatural.....or more accurately like it require preternatural hearing to be able to appreciate/interpret its nuisances.  It is fuckin soul stirring!  I can not imagine what it would be like to have my chakras tickled by it...Actually, I can because your fuckin writing here is GODDAMN IN-FUCKIN-TENSE!!
 

    8.  Being challenged on my dualism.  (This is the "Rhazes, you might
    be part of convincing me to give up a long-cherished aspect of my
    theology" moment.)  Recall how I have tried to say to us, to you: body
    AND spirit.  And you have said, "seulement spirit."  You have said
    this insistently.  I have always been surprised at how insistent,
    because frankly I thought when you heard my explanations you would be
    won over ;-).  Nope.  So, this group is way more in your camp than
    mine, lololol.  They always talk as if the body is just a temporary
    holder for the spirit.  For this they are called "Gnostic" by other
    Christian groups, which is also the word I have applied to you at
    times.  But I'm starting to see it differently.  I don't think they
    are Gnostic.  Gnosticism is highly dualistic; it implies the outlook
    that all reality is one of two things, either spirit or matter, and
    that matter is bad, evil.  The matter-is-bad part is why I don't like
    it.  And I assume that if folks are privileging spirit then they are
    necessarily implying that the physical realm is less valuable.  But …
    the Antioch folks don't think that at all.  In fact they are radical
    monists: all reality is one, spirit-matter-energy, only the forms
    differ.  And I realized that in fact I might be more Gnostic than they
    (or you).  As long as I insist on both body and spirit, I am quite a
    dualist myself, only differing from Gnostics by saying that matter and
    spirit are both good.  And … I need to give it up.  Because with
    everything I've been thinking (readings), and experiencing
    (particularly the palpability of the immaterial, with you), and
    getting challenged on ("seulement spirit"), the monist outlook just
    makes more sense regards reality.  At one time it was really important
    to me to emphasize the goodness of the body, because I felt
    Christianity and culture disregarded its holiness.  But this does not
    mean the physical realm need be understood as a realm unto its own.
    It's the same "stuff" as … spiritual stuff … as all stuff.
    Consciousness or energy or flow or God or the divine or whatever. (I'm
    tired and this might not be coming out as clearly as I'd like, but I
    tried … ;-))


Uh...this is must re-read. AND I will, but damn woman you challenge me...From my cock to the depth of my intellect...damn!!
 

    9.  For awhile the phrase "freelance monasticism" has been bouncing
    around in my head, and the Universe met me in this phrase in Santa Fe,
    in two forms: a) lots of the Antioch people talking about being "monks
    in the world," as if everyone knew what that meant, plus authors and
    titles of books that comprise a veritable "monks in the world"
    movement that I can look into; and b) Cindy and me, talking about this
    in the hot tub, and her riffing on it to say "monkettes in the world."
    I said, "Cindy, please don't let me write a book and make LOTS of
    money on what you just said."  So we laughed improvised on that,
    imagining the book cover of girl monks kicking up their burlap skirts,
    no underwear, etc.  It was completely silly.   But what was not silly
    was, on Sunday night, a whole workshop on being a monk in the world,
    specifically on a certain practice of prayer called centering prayer.
    At that point I couldn't even pretend to be doing research; I was
    there just trying to learn something with everyone else.

    10.  A new bishop, Alan Kemp, was consecrated at the Loretto Chapel on
    Saturday night.  The man looked so transcendently happy.  A round,
    pink-faced guy with white hair and a beard and a huge kind smile.  One
    of the scholars of the church, he also just radiates peace and love.
    During his consecration Mass, at the Kiss of Peace, he said something
    to me about my research methodology, like, "Participant-observation? I
    know all about that—I teach sociology; we should talk."  One of the
    times I cried in the services was when he passed by me on the way out
    after his consecration, because he was crying and smiling at the same
    time, and because he was for the first time making the sign of the
    cross over people as he passed, the prerogative gesture of a bishop.
    So.  It is traditional to ask a new bishop for a blessing, and at the
    back of the church dozens lined up to receive a laying-on of hands.  I
    was writing notes but really wanted to go to him, too.  In fact I
    would say the Spirit was strongly prompting me to go over.  Then a
    seminarian came up to me: "Did you get your new bishop juice?"  They
    make jokes like this, lolol.  I said, "No, but I think I will."  He
    said, "I think you should!"  So I stepped back to Bishop Kemp and
    tears are already streaming down my face and I said, "I ask your
    blessing and this is not participant-observation; this is just
    participation."  He smiled and said what do you want me to pray for.
    I said, whatever the new bishop knows to pray for me.  And I knelt
    before him and held up my hands, and he put his hands on my head and
    prayed a beautiful prayer that God would guide me where I needed to go
    and help me do what I needed to do, without fear.


This hits home in ways that are unpleasant and unsettling.  Achy here...this is a JuJu Abby hours long conversation in a coffee shop :-(
 BUT..I *really* understand this level of spiritual stirring ...at these times....

    11.  Smell of blunts wafting through the halls of the conference
    center every evening!  And discussion by me with others as to whether
    this could really be weed or not.  Some were like, someone's just
    doing smudging or burning incense.  I was like, I want some of that
    smudge stick or incense because that smells exactly like weed.  It was
    pretty funny.  My best guess actually is that it was weed and some
    self-medicate for arthritis and/or consider it part of their spiritual
    paths.  In any case, no one was scandalized at all, whether or no,
    which is why I called you and said we need to join this church, lolol.
    But, just in case smudging can smell like that ….??? … I bought a
    couple of blue sage smudge sticks with Cindy the next day, and have
    them here at home, and will try them out ;-).


Have you tried them? Well?  I remember one time at Penn State this weed political group had a rally on the lawn where they were passing out fake joints and the joints were made of sage.  I didn't go (it was one of the many things that caught my interest at Penn State that I did not pursue)

 

    12.  For the first time, I found myself wondering if things I
    previously reacted to in this group are actually just symptoms of my
    own resistances.  People there are talking about seeing auras and
    channeling Yeshua and seeing the future.  One man who had beat cancer
    was saying that "for those of us who are physically weak, we can do
    work at other levels of reality," that he spends "most of the day at
    those other levels, talking to creatures who are incredibly privileged
    to meet a human being."  Things like that.  About which I have
    huuuuuge skepticism.  But.  For the first time this visit, I was like,
    Julie, these are people who have gone fifty steps further on the
    mystical path than you have even imagined going.  Get over yourself.
    Stop intellectualizing everything.  Stop judging.  Stop reacting.  Who
    knows.


Same here.  I totally get this too.  Funny thing is that my reaction (from past experiences) is to say 'I believe.  I know. I just don't care. I don't care to pursue.'  And now, I have to revise that attitude.  I have to incorporate the fact that I am interested in the mystical path, just my particular rendition of it...and it is a personal and solo rendition (I think).  Solo in the sense that I have no desire to be in a community of like minded souls.  Does that make sense?  Can you hear that from the place where I am...a place of self-positivity and not reactionary negativity.  BUT...I would totally love to experience This (the church) through This...with you.  Question:  How would you feel about taking one of these trips together?  This is not a proposal (yet? :-) but an experimental question...would you feel comfortable, uninhibited, unencumbered?  Somehow, I think my presence would feel like a grand, This ruining intrusion.  Just curious. I think that this is an interesting thought experiment...don't you?

 

    13.  Great conversation with a seminarian who lives in LA, Bob Foss.
    A huge slob of a guy but extremely smart, he's an immigration lawyer
    in real life.  He's also a typical example of the Church of Antioch
    person who is into several different religions at once.  He's actually
    a priest and initiate of Mayan traditional spirituality.  So he was
    telling me this story about how he tried to start a bible study class
    during Lent, but all his Guatemalan neighbors had heard he did Mayan
    stuff, and came over for that, and they all ended up reading Mayan
    sacred literature instead, and, according to Bob, coming up with some
    really innovative readings of the texts.  Following that, he now he
    has a nice little side "ministry" going that involves doing
    divinations for Guatemalans, mostly young girls, mostly about their
    love lives, because they don't want to go to Guatemalans who would
    shortly have their business all out there in the streets.  He said,
    "Not exactly what I as a gay male Catholic Anglo had in mind when I
    thought of ministry, but hey, it's ministry."

    14.  Liza Molina (pronounced Leeza): talking with her first on Friday
    night; just sitting with her in sessions on Saturday; by Sunday we
    could get real and really talk.  We were just hanging out after lunch,
    and I told her that from the first I saw her I had really wanted to
    talk to her because she was beautiful and sexy and that I thought that
    even though I'm not gay or bi.  She laughed and said that was the
    first time anyone had said something like that to her in four years
    and it was very refreshing and welcome.  I then told her that I had
    told you about her, and that the best this straight girl could do was
    offer to get her together with me and the man I'm in love with.  And
    she laughed some more and said that was also refreshing and welcome,
    though she couldn't do it because "I don't share."    I think I could
    persuade her otherwise, though, because she was blushing and laughing
    a lot, and from what she described as her type, YOU, R. Spell, are on
    the money, lololol. Which I told her.  But she is married and not into
    sharing and demurred.  But not without telling me quite a bit of her
    history of relationships: black men, in the brown-skin range, as tall
    as possible, as handsome as possible ;-). But, her longest life
    relationship was with a woman, a black woman, Tanya.  Who was totally
    in love with her and wanted to marry her and bought her a big fat
    ring.  Tanya had cheated on her early in the relationship and Liza was
    devastated and threw her out of the house.  They eventually reconciled
    and spent four more years together.  But when the subject of marriage
    came up, Liza told Tanya she still couldn't trust her and perhaps they
    should go their separate ways.  Tanya's now married to another woman
    and they have two kids and she and Liza are still great friends.  And
    still have feelings for each other, though life has moved on.  She
    also complained about her husband a lot.  She said he is not her type
    and she wonders wtf she married him; that he puts on a great show for
    others but behind doors fights and bitches and does nothing for the
    household, which runs on her money; that she is a very sexual person
    and that they used to have sex twice a day but since they married four
    years ago have had sex only 3 times total; that if she weren't in
    several ways dependent on him now she would walk; that she still
    thinks about walking all the time.  I said, well, just so you know,
    you are beautiful and sexy and you could be having a lot of sex right
    now, if you wanted to.


Such pain in her... :-(
 

    15.  I also asked her about the MS.  She got a diagnosis in June of
    2001, after several years of misdiagnosis.  She had few symptoms for
    the first three years, but then came a time of huge stress and
    symptoms started; she took some of the conventional routes of
    treatment, which she hadn't done before because she didn't believe in
    them, but they only seemed to poison her body and make things worse.
    She now has pretty weak and slightly off-center legs and walks with a
    rolling walker.  She is back to trying about $1000/month worth of
    alternative therapies and is considering a trip to India for Vedic and
    yogic treatments over Christmas.  My perception was that she was not
    in a state of acceptance or "negativity" about it, though negativity
    is sort of part of her personality.  She seemed more to me just still
    post-shock that this has happened, and tired.  Really really tired.
    Tired, especially, of dealing with people close to her (husband, best
    friend, mother, even her fellow indie Catholics) who can't deal with
    her MS.  When we went out to Trader Joe's, I spent twenty minutes
    telling her to come into the store, and she spent twenty minutes
    telling me, no, no, it's too much of a pain in the ass.  I said,
    puhleez, I had a mother in a wheelchair for years.  She finally came
    in, sitting on the seat of her walker while I pushed her around.  It
    was a blast.  So.  My conclusions.  Liza was sent to me for all that
    good potential new girlfriend stuff that happened.  And I was sent to
    Liza for the same reason.


Such resiliency 

    16.  But also … (shhh … a "Fanta Se" fantasy on Monday morning … of
    Liza on her back, getting worked over by the two of us … black hair
    all over the pillow … nice medium-sized adobe-brown breasts fallen to
    either side … curly black bush with lots of juice stringing among lips
    and thick hair … legs akimbo and ultimately position-able … I am
    kissing her mouth, kissing her breasts, whispering to her … you are
    kissing her feet, kissing her thighs, everything but her pussy … for
    this session, I am playing mediatrix and that is my only role … she
    whispers to me, tell Rhazes to fuck me real hard already … and I turn
    my head to the side and repeat her wishes for punishment … and turn
    back and keep kissing her … but you say you will fuck her exactly as
    you please so the two of you just shut the fuck up … and from there,
    just from the expressions on her face I can tell exactly when you are
    playing the juices among her hairs … when you are brushing her lips
    with your fingertips and finding her cunthole … when you place the
    blazing hot phat head of the Ottoman against that sexy womanly starved
    opening … when you have traversed inch by inch by inch inside … and
    when you have gathered her soft ass off the bed in your hands, and
    tucked one of her slack legs under each of your arms and along the
    sides of your body … I am just watching her face and kissing her face
    and neck throughout … and shortly … and for a long time … my mouth
    cannot contain her moans and cries and calling your name … my ears
    cannot contain the lower guttural sounds you make as you feel the
    feeling of fucking a woman who cannot resist, literally cannot resist
    … and what that means … and how that turns you on …)
